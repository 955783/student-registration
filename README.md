# Student Registration System

This project is a simple student registration system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to register students, view the list of registered students, edit student details, and delete student records. The data is stored in the browser's local storage, so it persists even after refreshing the page.

## Features
- Register new students with their name, student ID, email, and contact number.
- Display the list of registered students in a table.
- Edit and delete student records.
- Validate input fields to ensure correct data entry.
- Persist data using local storage.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page.
- `scripts.js`: The JavaScript file for handling the form submission, data validation, and local storage operations.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Fill in the student registration form and click the "Register" button.
3. The registered students will be displayed in the table below the form.
4. Use the "Edit" button to edit a student's details.
5. Use the "Delete" button to remove a student from the list.

## Comments
- The JavaScript code includes functions for adding, editing, and deleting student records, as well as for persisting data in local storage.
- Input validation is implemented to ensure that student IDs and contact numbers are numeric, student names contain only characters, and email addresses are valid.
- The project structure is organized for ease of maintenance and readability.
